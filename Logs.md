# 20 Time Project - Leon Shainski


## Log 1

Today we are starting to create a tank game with Unity's tutorial. First thing we do is set up the scene. We put in their pre-made scene and 
alter a few things with them, namely the colours of the ground, buildings, etc. Then, we set up a camera. The guys explain how cameras in 
Unity work, and the differences between a Projection camera and an orthographic camera. We then make it so the camera makes the screen 
expand to encapture both tanks even as some move out of frame. They explore other concepts of making 3D games, such as making a skybox, 
making a background, and tweaking with field of view.

That's it for this log, not a very long part one, not much going on yet, so I summarised it as best I could. Already learning though!

## Introduction

Welcome to the actual log for my 20 time project. As you could tell from the previous log, trying to collaborate with the person I tried
making the game with kind of did not work. We didn't have a set idea for the game or how it was gonna be played out, and we had different 
skill sets that we tried to combine but ended up just conflicting with each other. Long story short, through all the ideas we bounced around
in terms of the game and all the other work we were trying to focus on meant we could not really do much collaboration.
 
However, I did want to make something. I knew this assignment was to teach yourself anything, really broad and really open, but this is of
course computer science course and since that is also what I want to do in life professionally I decided I needed to make some sort of 
program. I wanted to make a game, and another thing I wanted to do just in general in life is to learn how to use Unity, a game making 
program with the unity engine that really helps make complex things less complex so I could dream bigger. Furthermore, it turned out that 
Unity actually had some great tutorials about how to make some 3D games. 

[This is the tutorial I used](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/tanks-tutorial). 

That tutorial provided a template for creating a game, some pre-created aspects of it, and it also teaches a bit of c#, as well as showing 
how to make games in Unity. Essentially, over a couple hours with those guys in the tutorial series I was able to make a full fledged game.

Each part of the log corresponds to a part in the creating of the game (in the turorial). Thus there will be 8 logs for each part of the 
turorial.
