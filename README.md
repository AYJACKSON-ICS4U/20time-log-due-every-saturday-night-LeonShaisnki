# 20Time-ICS4U project
## Week 1 update

Not much happened this week in terms of work. Ideas have been bouncing back and fourth as to what the project should be (in the realm of developing an application), and progress has remained mainly stagnant until Friday (October 6th). We, as a group, have now decided we will work on something that would be useful to us, and thus we will be passionate about it. That something is a **Music Player**, being developed for *android*

This is a project I truly am passionate about since my new phone does not have a music player but rather uses google play music, which sucks beyond belief and is the one thing I have hated about my new phone. **Not Anymore**. The team and I are going to build a music player that works, for starters, and then we will be modifying it to include accessibility, customizability, and easy of use and operation (which the terrible UI of the google play music does not have).

So we set to work on setting up android studio and learning java (and whatever other language bits we will need to know as the requirements for the project become clear. The plan for this week is to get started with that and to maybe look at some source code for music players or anything else that has to deal with phone functions so as to understand what directions we need to gom with our learning. 

That is the end of this week's update, tune in next week for more
