# 20Time-ICS4U project
## Log 3

Well, the project fell apart. Not entierly, but it will be changed dramatically. We realised that making a music player will be a pretty big project, which means we may not be able to complete it to a very high standard and really make it our own aside from basic functionality. In addition to trying to learn how programming for android actually works and what it really takes, we also ran into other challenges, like the need to access the google API and source it. It would also be difficult as many people stream their music but our app would require it to be owned and stored locally on the phone. Furthermore, when developing for android you need to accomodate a lot of devices, and since we need to be able to allow the phone to control the app using external buttons on the phone there may be a problem with the fact that not all devices are built uniformly. Not to mention we also have to accomodate for older versions of android, meaning we may need to augment the premissions we ask for since different versions of android have different security levels and access to different resources. In short, the fact that android is so broad makes this a very broad project, which means we arenot in any capacity ready to tackle it (while we really wish we could, time constraints and other resposibilities are limiting). 

_thus_, we decided we would focus on something more simple which will allow us to learn the basics of android programming and releasing the app onto the app store while also allowing us to further expand with more features (given the time). After thinking long and hard about posibilities, we've decided on a tic ta toe game. Well, that is plan A, but plan B is already in planning in the case that plan A falls through again (can't be caught with our pants down again). I will not, however, reveal plan B unless we have to put it into action. 

The reason we chose tic tac toe is becaue, whilest it is simple enough for us to hopefully finish on time, it's simplicity also makes optimization for different android versions and phones less difficult. Also, it allows us more oprotunity to truly make it unique with a custom UI, and if we have enough time we may add cool features such as playing against the computer or playing against others online (though we will also need a server for that unless we can establish a P2P connection system, so no promises on that one). 

Overall we are excited to be making this transition, as we feel it will allow us more creative freedom and it is actually something in the realm of possibility. Thank you all for following our difficult journey, will update you again once more progress is made.

L-fam out.

This week my partner Clement and I set up Android studio at our computers as well as the school computers to allow us to work on our project. Then, using github and android studio, we collaborated to take a base build of a music player (containing basic functinality to allow us to use the phone's hardware, as in speakers and such) and have augmented it slightly to work with our version of android studio (which didn't like the source code we put in initially). Since then, everything has been uploaded to github so that we may both have the same exact version of the code, as well as allowing others to see what we're up to.

The plan for this week, seeing as we now have the same project and are on the same page, is to split off and begin work on separate parts of the program. Specific parts and who works on them has yet to be decided, however we are working towards that as we look at source code and tutorials to understand what our code must _actually_ include to work the way we invision it. The actual progression plan is not set anywhere since we both have very busy schedules with little free time, plenty of which is required since we need to sit down and collaborate together while working on this to ensure everything runs smoothly. 

That being said, I am sorry for missing last week's update, but frankly _nothing happened_ during that week anyway so it would have been rather dull. Thank you again for following the journey of our project moving forward, see you next week!

Not much happened this week in terms of work. Ideas have been bouncing back and fourth as to what the project should be (in the realm of developing an application), and progress has remained mainly stagnant until Friday (October 6th). We, as a group, have now decided we will work on something that would be useful to us, and thus we will be passionate about it. That something is a **Music Player**, being developed for *android*

This is a project I truly am passionate about since my new phone does not have a music player but rather uses google play music, which sucks beyond belief and is the one thing I have hated about my new phone. **Not Anymore**. The team and I are going to build a music player that works, for starters, and then we will be modifying it to include accessibility, customizability, and easy of use and operation (which the terrible UI of the google play music does not have). 

>Without music, life is journey through a desert -Pat Conroy

So we set to work on setting up android studio and learning java (and whatever other language bits we will need to know as the requirements for the project become clear. The plan for this week is to get started with that and to maybe look at some source code for music players or anything else that has to deal with phone functions so as to understand what directions we need to gom with our learning. 

That is the end of this week's update, tune in next week for more
