# 20Time-ICS4U project
## Week 3 Update

This week my partner Clement and I set up Android studio at our computers as well as the school computers to allow us to work on our project. Then, using github and android studio, we collaborated to take a base build of a music player (containing basic functinality to allow us to use the phone's hardware, as in speakers and such) and have augmented it slightly to work with our version of android studio (which didn't like the source code we put in initially). Since then, everything has been uploaded to github so that we may both have the same exact version of the code, as well as allowing others to see what we're up to.

The plan for this week, seeing as we now have the same project and are on the same page, is to split off and begin work on separate parts of the program. Specific parts and who works on them has yet to be decided, however we are working towards that as we look at source code and tutorials to understand what our code must _actually_ include to work the way we invision it. The actual progression plan is not set anywhere since we both have very busy schedules with little free time, plenty of which is required since we need to sit down and collaborate together while working on this to ensure everything runs smoothly. 

That being said, I am sorry for missing last week's update, but frankly _nothing happened_ during that week anyway so it would have been rather dull. Thank you again for following the journey of our project moving forward, see you next week!




## Week 1 update

Not much happened this week in terms of work. Ideas have been bouncing back and fourth as to what the project should be (in the realm of developing an application), and progress has remained mainly stagnant until Friday (October 6th). We, as a group, have now decided we will work on something that would be useful to us, and thus we will be passionate about it. That something is a **Music Player**, being developed for *android*

This is a project I truly am passionate about since my new phone does not have a music player but rather uses google play music, which sucks beyond belief and is the one thing I have hated about my new phone. **Not Anymore**. The team and I are going to build a music player that works, for starters, and then we will be modifying it to include accessibility, customizability, and easy of use and operation (which the terrible UI of the google play music does not have). 

>Without music, life is journey through a desert -Pat Conroy

So we set to work on setting up android studio and learning java (and whatever other language bits we will need to know as the requirements for the project become clear. The plan for this week is to get started with that and to maybe look at some source code for music players or anything else that has to deal with phone functions so as to understand what directions we need to gom with our learning. 

That is the end of this week's update, tune in next week for more
